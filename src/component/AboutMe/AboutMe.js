                            My name is Connor Cote. I have three older siblings, four nephews (soon to have one niece), many
                            many cousins and spend the majority of my time focused on family, friends and work. I am in this
                            class primarily to help my current career in the technology consulting field. I have a business
                            background and want to learn more about web development and coding in particular. My story
                            really starts in Atlanta where I was born and raised. I attended Saint Jude elementary school
                            before attending Marist School starting in 7th grade. After Marist, I went north to attend
                            Boston College (a school where I felt at home since all three of my siblings, my parents and my
                            in-laws also attended). At Boston College, I majored in Finance and Accounting with a French
                            language minor. I also had the opportunity to spend some time abroad during my junior year
                            spending first semester in Paris, France (I was there in during the 2015 bombings and terrorist
                            attack and am happy to discuss it if you are interested). I spent second semester in Hong Kong
                            and traveled throughout Southeast Asia.
